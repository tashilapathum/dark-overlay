This simple Rainmeter skin just adds a dark overlay on top of the wallpaper. It could pop out your other skins or stop the wallpaper from flashbanging you. I'm way too sleepy to think of clever names, so it's just named DarkOverlay. Time & date skin is not included!

## Installation

[Rainmeter Skin Installation Guide](https://docs.rainmeter.net/manual/installing-skins/#InstallAutomatically)

Download the `.rmskin` file from the releases.
After the skin is installed and loaded, do the following from skin settings:

1. Set position to **On desktop**
2. Enable **Click through**

## Customization

By default, this skin will make the wallpaper twice as dark.  
You can adjust how translucent the skin is by one of the following methods:

### Method 1
Adjust transparency from skin settings. This is the easy way for a quick change, but you can **only make it lighter**.  
Use the second method to make it darker.

### Method 2
Set the transparency by editing the **last value** of `SolidColor` in `DarkOverlay.ini`. You can also change the overlay color by editing the other `SolidColor` values!

```ini
SolidColor=0,0,0,180
